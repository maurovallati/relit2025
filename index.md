# Reasoning and Learning for Intelligent Transport

This is the website for the [ECAI 2025](https://ecai2025.org/) Workshop ReLiT on Reasoning and Learning for Intelligent Transport.


## Call for Papers
It is expected that, during the 21st century, there will be a huge growth in urbanisation. In 2014 54% of the global population were living in urban areas, and this is projected to rise to 66% by 2050. This increase in urbanisation, coupled with the socio-economic motivation for increasing mobility, is going to push the transport infrastructure well beyond its current capacity. 

To tackle the expected growth in urbanisation, advanced traffic control mechanisms are required for situational understanding and informed decision-making to maintain a high level of service in urban traffic networks. Fortunately, a variety of data is becoming increasingly available to support innovations in control and mobility. Sensors are becoming more widespread and more reliable, and the traffic infrastructure itself is increasing the quality and quantity of data that can be acquired. Further, the advent of connected and autonomous vehicles provides an additional set of sensing modalities and the ability to communicate information to the traffic infrastructure or to neighbouring vehicles.

The aim of this special track is to foster the investigation and development of safe, robust, and trustworthy AI-based techniques for innovation in urban traffic control and urban mobility. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
*	Traffic signal control and optimisation
*	Traffic assignment and distribution
*	Public transport optimization and control
*	Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
*	Fleet and logistics optimisation
*	AI approaches to on-demand transport 
*	Multi-modal transport and travel planning
*	Smart urban traffic simulation
*	Interaction between traffic control and rail traffic management
*	Long/short term traffic prediction
*	The role of interpretability in traffic control
*	Normative reasoning in intelligent transport systems
*	AI & law in the smart city context
*	Security by design in urban traffic control and mobility
*	The combination of model-based and data-driven approaches for transport

## Submission Instructions
Two types of papers can be submitted. Full technical papers with a length up to 7 pages (including references) are standard research papers. Short papers with a length between 2 and 4 pages can describe either a particular application, or focus on open challenges. All papers should conform to the ECAI style template.

Single-blind reviewing is used, so submitted papers must use fake/anonymized author names and affiliations. Papers must use the latest template and must be submitted as PDF.

Papers must be submitted as PDF through the [EasyChair conference system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=relit2025).

## Deadlines
* Paper submission deadline: July 15th, 2025 
* Notification: August 8th, 2025
* Camera-ready paper submission: TBC, 2025
