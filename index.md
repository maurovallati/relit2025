# AI for Urban Traffic Control and Mobility

This is the website for the [FLAIRS 2025](https://www.flairs-38.info/) Special Track on AI for Urban Traffic Control and Mobility.


## Call for Papers
It is expected that, during the 21st century, there will be a huge growth in urbanisation. In 2014 54% of the global population were living in urban areas, and this is projected to rise to 66% by 2050. This increase in urbanisation, coupled with the socio-economic motivation for increasing mobility, is going to push the transport infrastructure well beyond its current capacity. 

To tackle the expected growth in urbanisation, advanced traffic control mechanisms are required for situational understanding and informed decision-making to maintain a high level of service in urban traffic networks. Fortunately, a variety of data is becoming increasingly available to support innovations in control and mobility. Sensors are becoming more widespread and more reliable, and the traffic infrastructure itself is increasing the quality and quantity of data that can be acquired. Further, the advent of connected and autonomous vehicles provides an additional set of sensing modalities and the ability to communicate information to the traffic infrastructure or to neighbouring vehicles.

The aim of this special track is to foster the investigation and development of safe, robust, and trustworthy AI-based techniques for innovation in urban traffic control and urban mobility. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
*	Traffic signal control and optimisation
*	Traffic assignment and distribution
*	Public transport optimization and control
*	Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs)
*	Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
*	Fleet and logistics optimisation
*	On-demand transport 
*	Traffic data management
*	Urban traffic simulation
*	Interaction between traffic control and rail traffic management
*	Long/short term traffic prediction
*	The role of interpretability in traffic control
*	Threat modeling in urban traffic control and mobility
*	Cyber Threat Analysis in urban traffic control and mobility
*	Security by design in urban traffic control and mobility

## Submission Instructions
There are three kinds of submissions: full paper—a paper of high quality, which will be published in the proceedings (up to 6 pages plus references) and will be presented by the author in a corresponding track (20 minute oral presentation); short paper—a paper that shows some novelty and general interest, but is more preliminary or in the early stages of development, which also get published in the proceedings (up to 4 pages plus references) and the author presents the work in a poster session; and poster paper, which will be published as a poster paper (up to 2 pages plus references) and the author presents the work in a poster session. 

Rejected full papers might be accepted as short papers or posters, if reviewers found interest in the idea but the paper quality was not sufficient to be published in full length. 

Appendices after the references are permitted but might not be reviewed, and appendices will not be permitted in the final version of the paper if it is accepted. 

Double-blind reviewing is used, so submitted papers must use fake/anonymized author names and affiliations. Papers must use the latest template and must be submitted as PDF.

Papers must be in format provided in FLAIRS-38 website, and submitted as PDF through the [EasyChair conference system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flairs38), which is also available in the main conference web site. The proceedings of FLAIRS-38 will be published by [Florida OJ](https://journals.flvc.org/FLAIRS/index). In order for a paper to be published in the proceedings, the paper must be accompanied by at least one AUTHOR REGISTRATION.  It is also expected that for a full (i.e., maximum 6-page) paper, at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present their work. In order for a poster to be presented at the conference, it must also be accompanied by an AUTHOR REGISTRATION.

## Deadlines
* Paper abstract submission deadline: January 20, 2025 
* Paper submission deadline: January 27, 2025 
* Notification: March 10, 2025
* Camera-ready paper submission: April 9, 2025
